# Pre-Work Study Guide Webpage
## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created to help boot camp students who are going through Prework to introduce concepts and best practices before the course begins. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

The motivation behind this project was to learn the ins and outs of GitHub, Git Flow and create introductory content for HTML, CSS, JavaScript as I begin my bootcamp experience to become a web developer. It was also to create a project from the beginning stages through to deployment.

This project was built as an introduction to coding, with the support of my university bootcamp, and personally, to begin applying my newly found excitement for coding, web development, problem solving and how this industry works.

The acquired learning so far in this project has been important on my personal journey and for the purposes of providing a glimpse of basic coding practices. To learn basics about GitHub, and the process of creating a professional and public presence as a web developer through GitHub has beneficial. Learning how process documentation works with pushing, pulling, committing and merging content through the Git Flow has also been new and insightful. I am excited to learn how this process works with teams and collaborators on a project and in other real-world scenarios.

This Prework Study Guide houses four main sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. Within each, there will be notes and pertinent beginner information specific to that coding language. The purpose of each section will be to learn more about how each work independently or in collaboration with one another.

If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
